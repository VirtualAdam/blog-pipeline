# Sample Draft: Platform Engineering ROI

I have a thought about leveraging AI to convert your creative thoughts to actionable steps.  My creative process has two main steps. 1 creative divergence, where a creative mind can come up with many divergent solutions for a problem.  Constructive convergence, where I apply logic and judgement to my many ideas to find the one that best solves my problem.  This is a standard inovation thought pattern for many.  However I have a problem of mindset and setting such that whenever I'm in front of my computer I can never seem to get into the mindset of creative divergence. The simple act of sitting in front of a keyboard changes my mindset to one of problem solving and execution. on the other hand when I am in a relaxing position such as when I'm driving by in a empty car, or when I am relaxing in my hot tub my brain is able to generate many creative thoughts. I wish I had is a way to capture those thoughts while in a relaxed state And make them available to myself when I'm ready to execute. That wish was the Genesis for this blog platform.  I now am able to input creative thoughts through a simple interface like voice capture notes that are committed to a draft branch of a repo at that point this pipeline should do the rest and should convert the thought into a structure that is executable once I am again in front of my computer
