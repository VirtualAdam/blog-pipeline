 I think it's a really important to learn out loud meaning when you do your learning write the things that you've learned the things that you've discovered the mistakes that you've made write them in a public space so that a more people can learn from your mistakes and be so that you can mentally check that learning as done for whatever reason when it's not written down or when it's not shared the learning doesn't count as done counts as part of an iteration on a thing that you're still turning on and it requires some sort of artifact in order for your brain to say Yep I've learned that and now I'm gonna build on it and even though there's plenty of other ways to do this, I'm sure you could do this in a private journal as well the practice of writing down your learning so that you can move on is important and I would assert that there is a true value for the people around you to be able to see what you're learning and either that it would help you or help them
