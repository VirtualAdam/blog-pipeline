 A colleague of mine has the superpower of critical listening and I've noticed that when I have a really good idea a really cutting edge idea he's one of the first people I want to talk to because he's able to understand it. Well, I would like to emulate that more myself where I am good critical listening, and the leaders that I want to support come to me first to share their ideas because there's some I'm someone they trust to understand and listen well OK.
